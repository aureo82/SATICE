JACS.py - Just Another Communications Script

The program implements control over:
    - Hardware interface: serial channel of the modem and GPIO to power it on/off
    - Compression and split of archives to create smaller packets with CRC control
    - Query of status of Iridium
    - Send data as ASCII strings:
        - Through raw serial connection with normal data.
        - Through SBD.
        - Through PPP-FTP.
        - Through Rudics.

A configuration file is used containing the following setup:
  - MTU packet size: MTU
  - Operation mode: OM [0] Raw, [1] SBD, [2] PPP-FTP, [3] Rudics.
  - Temp folder path: TF '/home/satice/new/temp'
  - Origin folder of the data to be transfered: OF
